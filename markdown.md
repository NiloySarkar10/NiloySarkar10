# Markdown first attempt


## Introduction

This is my first attempt at creating a markdown file. There are a number of benefits of using markdown files for documentation, primarily
the ease of reading.


### First encounter

My first encounter with markdown started when I was reading technology articles on various public forums and on social media. Various content creators would use markdown to enhance the matter that the would present.


### Encounter at work

Markdown soon made its way into my day to day work life, when I saw the PR that we had to raise had all this intuitive questions and information about the code that we wrote. It helped the reviewer and also the developer to properly articulate the vital information about the code.


## Some cool Markdown bits that I came across

1. Adding URL links to the document. Here is an example of the same [Google](https://www.google.com/)
2. Making text **bold** 
3. _Italisizing_ texts
4. ~~Strikethrough~~ is also available
